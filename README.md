# Centtrip Interview Project
This project is using my credential at the marvel.com and connects to the MarvelAPI.
you can receive all the character Ids using this url localhost/characters or get any character information using localhost/characters/(id of the character).
after first request for getting all the Ids it will cache the data in the memory and will be faster for future calls.

If I had more times I would have done these changes to improve:
1. Adding test methods
2. Adding an async structer
3. Making the base url to support other entities
4. Logging the calls and errors info
